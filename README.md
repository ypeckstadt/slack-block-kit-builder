# Block Kit builder for Slack apps



The Slack created blockkit package is clear and easy to work with when creating Slack apps. However, as you start building Slack apps UI's you will notice that you start copy pasting and repeating the same code over and over again...fast.  To avoid this I wrote a simple BlockKitBuilder static class which helps me to keep my Slack app UI code to a minimum.   It also helps me to avoid easily made mistakes.



The class is written in typescript.
